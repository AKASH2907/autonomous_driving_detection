Indian Driving Dataset Segmentation Challenge NCVPRIPG'19

No of submissions left -- 15

# Things to work upon 
Look for repo containing cityscapes dataset and run the codes anyhow 
Cityscapes have void classes look for it

1) divamgupta github repo -> Tomorrow 1st submission
2) qubvel segmentation models
3) Pixel Intensity problem --> Serious

1) UNet

# Concepts to look upon
1) FCN-8, 16, 32 difference
2) 

# Paper to look upon
1) Dealing with 
2) Efficient Net
3) PSP Net
4) 


# Problems Currently facing
1) How to deal with unlabeled pixels in image segmentation?
2) Dealing with instance labels in the dataset
3) 


Questions to ask:
1) In segmentations, what is the image shape of masks? How do you read using cv2 or imageio? Because bothare taking different shapes?
With cv2 it reads 3,3,3 and imageio reads 3
2) Is there any .txt file needed in segmentation like for class information or something? Isn't they learn directly from pixelwise cross
entropy loss?
3) Gud resources for segmentation github that I can use as reference?
4)
